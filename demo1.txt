I receive a lot of LinkedIn connections, but very few with a message.

I cannot stress how important those are.

Here are some guidelines and templates you can use (make sure to add your own style).

DO's:
✔️ Send a message
✔️ Introduce yourself
✔️ Mention how you found them
✔️ Connect on common ground (shared interests, groups, mutual connections, employers...)
✔️ Tell the specific reason you’re reaching out
✔️ Be direct & add value

DONT'S
✖️ Use canned invitations
✖️ Ask for a job or anything that would make the person uncomfortable
✖️ Spam with irrelevant messages
✖️ Make grammar mistakes
✖️ Cold message without a good reason
✖️ Expect everyone to accept your request

As your craft your message, your request should have these five P’s:
➖ Polite
➖ Pertinent
➖ Personalized
➖ Professional
➖ Praiseful

Now here are a few templates that you can use to start connecting and building your network on LinkedIn.
